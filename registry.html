				<p>we've created a honeymoon registry. we'll be doing a two-week, 2000 mile trip through New England, hitting Lake Placid,
      New York; Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Boston, Massachusetts; Acadia National Park, Maine; White Mountain National Forest,
      New Hampshire; Burlington, Vermont; and Montreal, Quebec on the way home why not a typical registry? there are two
      major reasons why we felt a typical registry wasn’t for us. we don't like things and we do like experiences. we want
      to avoid amassing a bunch of stuff we don't value and won't ever use. we'd much rather spend time with people we care
      about, adventure in nature, and explore new interests. by the time the wedding rolls around, we'll have already lived
      together for two years. in this time, we've had ample opportunity to identify our consumer needs and outfit our home.
      in short, we really don't need anything. what is a honeymoon registry? a honeymoon registry is really quite similar
      to a typical registry; the major difference is that honeymoon registries are specific to the honeymoon! they generally
      include things like travel expenses, accommodations, activities, and restaurants for the couple to enjoy on their honeymoon.
      we have tried to maintain a good balance between these four categories in our registry. how does this registry work?
      our registry is running on Shopify's e-commerce platform. we decided to use a Shopify store for two reasons. first,
      Roger works for Shopify so we understand and trust this platform, and second, existing honeymoon registries often take
      an insane financial cut that can exceed 10% of gifted dollars meaning that 10 cents on every dollar you think you're
      giving the couple actually goes to the company hosting their registry! as a staff store, Shopify hosts our registry
      "at cost" which is 2%. and don't worry, we'll pay that 2%! since our registry has been set up as an online store, you
      can expect to navigate it as you would any other online store. all of our registry items appear as products which you
      can filter by type and cost. when you click on an item, you'll see a short description and the option to add it to
      your cart. just like a normal registry, we have included a specific number of each gift. often, the quantity available
      for purchase is 1, however we've split up some of the big ticket items and included multiples of others like tanks
      of gas and gift store vouchers. in these cases, the product description will tell you that you're buying half a night
      at a hotel or one of four trips to a whole foods, for example. if you add more of one item than is available for purchase,
      the cart will automatically notify you when you go to check out, giving you the opportunity to reassess. the store
      will not let you buy more of a given item than is "in stock." when you check out, we will receive your name and the
      details of your gift. the store will automatically deposit the cost of the gift into our bank account. we'll take the
      cash and apply it directly to the gift you've selected - we promise! If you have the opportunity, please make us a
      coupon, scrapbook page or some other cutesy craft in commemoration! cheques and other alternative gifts if you feel
      you would rather provide us with cash directly, this is totally fine. in this case please know that Jessica will not
      be changing her name. cheques can be made out to "Roger Kirkness" or "Jessica Powell" or "Roger Kirkness and Jessica
      Powell". to avoid issues at the bank, please do not write "Roger and Jessica Kirkness", "Mr. and Mrs. Kirkness," or
      other similar combinations. if it is super super important to you to give us a physical gift, please consider a book
      or two rather than department store-esque gifts - if you've been to our home, you probably noticed our growing collection
      of quickly-filling bookshelves. we love books on human nature, nation building, genetics and evolution, biographies,
      and classics. if you're concerned about doubling up, you can find a link to our personal catalogue here. thank you
      we greatly appreciate any support you are willing to offer us, and expect nothing more than your smiling faces at our
      wedding. we look forward to taking silly pictures and sharing them with you as a token of our gratitude. - Roger and
      Jess</p>
