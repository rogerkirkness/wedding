										As told by Roger...<br><br>
										Jess and I met at summer camp at UTM in July 2004. Things have only gone downhill from there. Just kidding. After meeting, we continued hanging out together each year at camp through 2007. Once camp ended and we entered our high school and university years, we continued to keep in touch. We reconnected again around the fall of 2014. At that point we realized we knew what we wanted, and how compatible we were with each other. We always enjoyed our time together, and have never (and still haven't) run out of things to talk about. We moved in together in summer of 2015. As a result of moving in together we became sure we wanted to spend our lives together. I proposed on the lawn that we first met at UTM on February 29th, 2016 - 12 years after we met. Since then we have spent our time working (me) and completing graduate school (Jess) while preparing for our wedding and life that comes after it. I am grateful to have met Jess and I feel very fortunate to have found someone I enjoy the company of so much. We look forward to sharing our excitement with everyone at our wedding.
