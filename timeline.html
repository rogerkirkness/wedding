										As told by Roger...<br><br>
										Jess and I met at summer camp in Mississauga at U of T in July 2004. Things have only gone downhill from there. Just kidding. We kept seeing each other each year at camp through 2007 before the camp we were attending ended. Throughout our high school and university years, we always enjoyed staying in touch with each other to talk about life. We made the effort to stay in contact and got back in touch with each other once again around the fall of 2014. I think there was some kind of intellectual bond there that we (or perhaps mostly me) were not aware of until we actually got together. At that point we realized that we had the self awareness to identify the things we wanted, and how compatible those things were with each other. We always enjoyed our time together, and have never (and still haven't) run out of things to talk about. We moved in together around the summer of 2015. As a result of that process it seemed clear that we wanted to spend our lives together, so I proposed on the lawn that we first met at U of T on February 29th, 2016. Since then we have spent our time working (me) and finishing graduate school (Jess) while preparing for the wedding and our life that comes after it. We have always been somewhat strange in our love for all things monotonous and adult-like and I have no doubt that getting married will solidify our ability to be more adult-like and happy than ever. I am grateful to have met Jess, I am not sure I would have found her if I tried and I feel fortunate to have encounted and held on to someone so well suited to being my life partner.
